        <p>I had the idea of this app for awhile now. While learning code I ran into the same problem I had with Math. 
            I am very good at Math. I was in honors Math classes, I took AP calculas. I could solve problems but I couldn't tell you
            what the name of the formula I used is, also I couldn't tell you what a binomial is but I could solve them. I suck at terminology. 
            I think I'm pretty good at solving problems in code but I probably couldn't name the method I used. So much like flashcards I thought this might help me.
