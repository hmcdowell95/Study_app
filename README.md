# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# study_app

This study app is more specifically called My NoteCard App. It's like vitual Flashcards. 
All NoteCards are organized by subject. First you create a Subject then from that subject you can create NoteCards for that Subject. All NoteCards will show the term and then when you click on the term it shows the definition. Then click again to hide it.

## API

This app uses a rails API database. If bundle install doesn't run right away run 'bundle install' in the backend folder.

## package.json

When you run 'npm start' it will set the Port to 5000 because the API use port 3000.
Make sure you start up the API server 'rails s' then in the project run 'npm start'

'cd notecard-backend' > 'rails s' in one terminal
**if needed 'cd study-app'
'npm start'
